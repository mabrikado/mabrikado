I am a final-year Software Development student at WeThinkCode_, with a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, agile development, teamwork, and web technologies.  

Problem-solving is my favorite aspect of software development — I enjoy breaking down complex requirements into manageable steps and iterating towards effective solutions.
