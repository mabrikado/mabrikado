## 🔥 About Me  
I am a final-year Software Development student at WeThinkCode_, with a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, agile development, teamwork, and web technologies.  

Problem-solving is my favorite aspect of software development — I enjoy breaking down complex requirements into manageable steps and iterating towards effective solutions.  

I also find value in creating and maintaining libraries that other developers can use. My focus is on simplicity, clarity, and reusability to support efficient development practices and foster collaboration within the developer community.  

Additionally, I have been working on **Sakhi Construction** and **SheshaPay**, projects that demonstrate both my backend and frontend development capabilities, using frameworks like **Spring Boot**, **Next.js**, and **Django**.
