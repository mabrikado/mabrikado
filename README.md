## 🔥 About Me  

I am a final-year Software Development student at **WeThinkCode_**, with a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, agile development, teamwork, and web technologies.  

Problem-solving is my favorite aspect of software development — I enjoy breaking down complex requirements into manageable steps and iterating towards effective solutions.  

I also find value in creating and maintaining libraries that other developers can use. My focus is on **simplicity**, **clarity**, and **reusability** to support efficient development practices and foster collaboration within the developer community.  

Additionally, I have been working on **Sakhi Construction** and **SheshaPay**, projects that demonstrate both my backend and frontend development capabilities using modern web technologies.
